# Education

## Undergraduate Education

**School of Electronics and Information Engineering, [Tiangong University](https://www.tiangong.edu.cn/), Tianjin, China**      

Undergraduate of `Telecommunication Engineering`, Class of 2023, Sep. 2019 — Present       

`GPA:3.80/4.0` ,  `Rank 3/120 in major`

`Specialized Courses` Machine Learning and Bigdata Processing (90) / Digital Signal Processing (89) / Computer Networks (95) / Mathematical Modeling / Signals and Systems / Microcontroller / EDA Theory & VHDL Programming (96) / Communication Theory / High-Frequency Electronics / Electromagnetics / A&D Electronics (91) / C Programming (92) / Linear Algebra (90), etc.    

## High School Education

**[Changjun High School](http://www.changjun.com.cn/), Changsha, China**

Duration: 2016-2019.

Some may argue that why I show my high school experience in such a formal blog. Actually, my high school is among the top 4 high schools in China. I have benefited a lot from the education Changjun had given me. I never forget the school's motto, which is "to love life, to master thinking, to benefit the world, and to make accomplishments"(in Chinese: 爱生活，善求知，忧天下，有作为). This motto has always been the beacon in my journey to persue knowledge and overcome barriers. 

I actually experienced the so-called "Waterloo" debacle in Gaokao, but I still kept fighting. Though I was highlighted by many prizes during my high school life, I did not get a concret answer about what to endeavor in the lifelong journey. During my university life, I appreciate much about my classmates and teachers. Because I have met a lot of friends who are very nice, and more importantly, I have found what I really love, which is building intelligent mobile robots that can freely travel on the world (e.g. autonomous driving cars, and autonomous robots as the Boston Dynamics has introduced). I understand what I love will take a lot to finally achieve, so I will continue to push my boundaries till the day comes.

(Sounds a little bit sentimental, but I am actually a firm person in reality, lol. I will back to academic style in the next sections~ **I am trying to conclude it in my Statement of Purpose that why I have become determined to learn CV/Robotics and my research experience**)

# Active Researches

## **Semantic Road Segmentation Based on Adapted Poly-YOLO** 

Jun. 2022 — Present, MA, United States (Remote)

**Research Intern** 

**Supervisor: Mark Vogelsberger, Professor,** *Massachusetts Institute of Technology* 

- Discussed deeper theories of several foundamental neural network structures, especially those used in autonomous driving. Also, different tricks used in enhancing the network’s performance have been tested by hand buiding different kind of networks from scratch. 


- Aimed at the semantic road segmentation using object detection based methods, and make improvements upon the baseline models since the baseline model is not tuned for this specific scenario: 1) the anchors are not tuned for detecting large road targets; 2) the preprocessing mechanism for datasets to transform the masks into vertices is not accurate; 3) the pre-training dataset is limited.

- Improved the baseline model by allocating the anchors after splitting objects into three categories by the size, and also by training on larger datasets. The mAP at 0.5~0.95 IoU rised from 0.4 to over 0.8, the performance on detecting and segmenting small size objects is also enhanced, making the adapted model more reliable in real world road segmentation scenario. The result of this work is being presented in a paper.



## **High Precision Object Detection Based on Polygon Bounding Boxes**             

Sep.2021 — Present, CA, United States (Remote)

**Research Intern** 

**Supervisor: Ian Deng, PhD,** *University of California, San Diego*

- Aimied to design an adapted object detection algorithm which generates object locations with a more precise boundry, providing more accurate localization which is less affected by the background.

- Planned to generate polygon localizations which wraps the object more precisely than traditional rectangular bounding boxes, shifting the coordination regression task on the rectangle corners to the vertices of a polygon bounding box. 

- Designed to use YOLOv3 as the backbone, with the technique route being referred to the previous work Poly-YOLO, and the work was expected to be presented in a paper under preparation.

Collaborator: Yuxiang Wang, *School of Electronic and Information Engineering,* *Tiangong University*               

Mar. 2022 — Jun. 2022

- Developed a model that can better autonomically detect subtle small liver cancer (*small hepatocellular carcinoma*) characteristics in CT scans and has the reliable accuracy for diagnosis, which applied to the detection of early liver cancer that is difficult to be distinguished by naked eyes.

- Combined the self-attention mechanism, often used in the field of natural language processing, with the convolutional neural network Efficient-net to improve the self-learning ability of the model, endowing the front end of the whole detection algorithm with an extraordinary ability to compare features between healthy livers and those with small liver cancer in CT scan images.

- Achieved a test detection accuracy of > 97% after training on the LiTS dataset; contributed as the co-first author.

## **Tianjin Provincial Project of The College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Plan**

**Project Number: 202110058107**

**Certificate Number: 20210537**

***Title: Fire Detection System Based on Deep Learning Quadrotor UAV***                 

**Team Leader**       

Supervisor: Yukuan Sun, *School of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Tiangong University*     

Tianjin, China 

Mar. 2021 — May 2022                 

- Targeted at researching novel visual detection algorithms and relative deployment on mobile processing platforms. Trained and tested different traditional fire-detection CNN models and deployed them on a Jetson Nano Developer Kit, constructed an experimental quadrotor UAV prototype.

- Since traditional CNN detection models require massive dataset and huge computational capacity, a novel and efficient algorithm based on adapted I-Vector was proposed, which focuses on dynamic features of fire combustion instead of any static shape of fire. Achieved 91% detection accuracy after training on a dataset of only 1296 sequences (< 9 MB).

- Gave an **oral presentation** on the ***2022 3rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning*** *(PRML 2022)* to be held on July 22, 2022.

The funding was raised by our own and we had been gone through many troublesome procedures when contacting sponsors, singers, and cooperating with the venue leasing agents. But the liveshow turned out to be rather impressive. 
  - During 2019~2020, I was a member of Tiangong University Chamber Chorus where I sang in the tenore division.
- Enjoying smart devices(especially those with high intelligence)
  - I have become an IEEE Member in 2022!
  - I also love mobile vehicles (including autonomous cars, UAVs, robots). [Misc of My UAV Experience](./MyUAVExperience.html).
- Appreciating tasty cuisines, I am actually a connoisseur of tasting, but a layman when I have to cook, lol.
- Cars. I am an "old" observer of the car market, and I like both motors and cars.
